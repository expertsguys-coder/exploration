    "### Jupyter Notebook: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "# This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. OOP is a programming paradigm that uses **objects** and **classes** to structure and organize code, making it more modular, reusable, and easier to manage.\n",

    "### 1. Introduction to OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Class?** üè¢\n",
    "# class is a **blueprint** or **template** for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects will have. Think of it like a cookie cutter: the cutter itself is the class, and the cookies you make are the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Object?** üöó\n",
    "# An object is an **instance** of a class. It's a real-world entity created from the class blueprint. Each object has its own unique set of attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Core OOP Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "# OOP is built on four fundamental pillars.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1. Encapsulation üîê\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, a class. It also involves **data hiding**, which restricts direct access to some of the object's components. This protects the data from accidental modification. In Python, this is done by convention using underscores (`_` or `__`).\n",
